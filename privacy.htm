Privacy Policy

Last updated: 1/4/2026

1. Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how [App Name] (“the App”) collects, uses, and protects data obtained through the Oura API.

This App is a personal-use application developed and operated by a single individual for the purpose of accessing and analyzing their own Oura Ring data only. The App is not offered to the public, does not support multiple users, and does not process data belonging to any other individuals.

2. Data Collected

Through your explicit authorization with Oura, the App may access the following categories of data associated with your personal Oura account:

Sleep data (e.g., duration, stages, sleep scores)

Activity data (e.g., steps, calories, activity scores)

Readiness data

Heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV)

Body temperature trends

Tags and related metadata

The App does not collect:

Contact information

Location data

Audio, photos, or video

Data from any users other than the developer

3. How Data Is Used

All accessed data is used solely for:

Personal analytics and visualization

Longitudinal health tracking

Personal experimentation, research, or automation

Integration into private dashboards or local analysis tools

The data is not used for advertising, profiling, marketing, or resale.

4. Data Storage and Security

Data may be stored locally on the developer’s device and/or on private infrastructure controlled exclusively by the developer.

Reasonable technical safeguards are used to protect stored data from unauthorized access.

OAuth tokens and credentials are kept private and are not shared.

Because the App is for personal use only, no external user accounts or databases are maintained.

5. Data Sharing

The App does not share data with third parties, including:

Advertisers

Analytics providers

Data brokers

Other individuals or organizations

Data is accessed solely via the official Oura API in accordance with Oura’s developer terms.

6. Data Retention

Data is retained only for as long as it is useful for personal analysis purposes. Data may be deleted manually at any time by the developer.

Revoking the App’s access via the Oura account settings will immediately stop any further data access.

7. User Rights

Because this App processes only the developer’s own data:

All data access, modification, and deletion is fully under the developer’s control

OAuth permissions can be revoked directly through Oura at any time

8. Children’s Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect or process data from children under the age of 13. It is not intended for use by anyone other than the developer.

9. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Updates will be reflected by changing the “Last updated” date above.
